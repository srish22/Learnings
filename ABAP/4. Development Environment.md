## 1. SAP System

- Complete environment where SAP software is installed â€” includes application server, database, development and configuration layers.
- Like ERX, EER that we use.
- SAP System consists of:
  - **Application Server**: Runs ABAP programs and user logic.
  - **Database**: Stores business and technical data.
  - **SAP Kernel**: 
    - Internal engine for memory management, communication, program execution, database access.
    - ðŸ“Œ *Analogy:* Kernel = Car engine, ABAP = Driver.
    - Compiled for OS/DB; updated through kernel patches.
  - **Repository**: Stores technical development objects.
  - **Client Sub-System**: Logical partitions inside the same SAP system.

### ðŸ”¹ Client Concept:
- Virtual sub-systems that separate data and configuration.
- ðŸ“Œ *Analogy:* System = Building, Clients = Apartments.
- Each client has its own users, customizing, and application data.
- Helps create Development, Test, Production setups inside the same system.
